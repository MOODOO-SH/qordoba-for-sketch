##### Uploading a page to Qordoba

To upload a selected Page to Qordoba, go to Plugins → Qordoba → Upload Current Page to Qordoba. You will be asked to choose which Organization and Project within Qordoba you’d like to send the Page to, in case you are a member of multiple Organizations / Projects. 

If the Page has already been sent to same Project, a versioning suffix will be
added to the end of the Page name within Qordoba.

##### Download a translated page from Qordoba

To download the translation of a Page, go to Plugins → Qordoba → Download Current Page. Choose what language you want to download (this is defined in your Qordoba project settings). Ta da! Your localized design will be downloaded as a separate page. 

##### Setting font settings

Select the Default Language Settings option in the plugin menu to automatically switch the fonts in your Artboards to the fonts you use in your live app/website. The Font Ratio feature allows you to automatically resize your font choices for particular languages (slightly bigger font for Asian languages, slightly smaller font for German, for example).
